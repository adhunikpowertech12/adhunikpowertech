                <p className=" font-sans font-normal mt-3">
                    While many in India colloquially use "AC" to refer to cooling systems, the term "HVAC" represents a far more encompassing and integrated approach to indoor environmental management. HVAC stands for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning. It's a system designed to regulate temperature, humidity, air quality, and air movement within an enclosed space, ensuring optimal comfort, health, and productivity.
