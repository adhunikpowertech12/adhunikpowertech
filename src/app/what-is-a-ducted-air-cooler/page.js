               Ducted Air Cooler
                  </Link>, also known as an evaporative cooler or swamp cooler, is a cooling system that utilizes the natural process of evaporation to lower air temperature. Unlike air conditioners that use refrigerants, ducted air coolers use water to cool the air. They are called "Ducted" because they distribute the cooled air through a network of ducts, similar to central heating systems.
