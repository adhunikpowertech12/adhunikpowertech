                   works on the principle of evaporative air cooling. Inside the air
                  washer, large, specially designed cooling pads are kept
                  constantly wet using a water distribution system. As hot, dry air
                  passes through these wet pads, water molecules absorb heat and
                  evaporate into the air. This process cools the air down
                  significantly, delivering a refreshing breeze to your workplace.

                </h2>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
  <li>
    <strong>Air Cooling :</strong> Air Washers are used to cool large industrial
    spaces or similar environments.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Improved Air Quality :</strong> The cooling pads act as natural filters,
    trapping dust, pollen, and other airborne irritants that can trigger allergies and asthma.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Maintained Humidity :</strong> Unlike air conditioners that can dry out
    the air, air washers add a touch of moisture, creating a more comfortable and
    breathable environment, especially in dry climates.
